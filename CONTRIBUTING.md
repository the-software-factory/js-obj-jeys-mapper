# How to contribute

## Getting Started
If you're experiencing any issue or know how to make this project better - this file should point you in the right
direction.

## Submitting an Issue
If you find any bug (and you're not able to fix it by yourself), think that the documentation is unclear or
have any question about the project - create an Issue!
Don't be afraid of pointing out the bugs or asking questions, but please make sure you read the
[Issues guide](http://guides.github.com/features/issues) first. Double-check that the ticket for your issue doens't
exist yet, than go ahead and submit your issue clearly describing it including steps to reproduce when it
is a bug.

## Pull requests
If you find a bug that you're able to fix, or maybe you think you can add some new awesome feature - go ahead, and
make your contribution! As soon as you'll have a working version of the code you can suggest to add your fixes
or new features to out project with the "Pull Request" procedure.

### The basic steps are as follows:
* [Fork](http://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository
* [Pull in changes](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) frequently in order to stay up to date and avoid
merge conflicts
* [Create](http://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) a branch for your edits
* Remember to follow [this](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/conventions/jshint.md) conventions to write the commit messages in order to be able to automatically generate the
CHANGELOG.md file
* Run all the existing tests, and eventually your own. Make sure that your changes didn't break the project
* Make a Pull Request; be clear about what problem is occurring and how someone can recreate that problem or why your
feature will help. Then be equally as clear about the steps you took to make your changes.
* Once you’ve opened a pull request a discussion will start around your proposed changes. You may be asked to make some
changes to your pull request, if so, add more commits to your branch and push them – they’ll automatically go into
the existing pull request.

If your pull request is merged – great! If it is not, no sweat, it may not be what the project maintainer had in mind,
or they were already working on it. This happens, so our recommendation is to take any feedback you’ve received and go
forth and pull request again – or create your own open source project.
